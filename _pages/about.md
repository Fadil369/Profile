I'm a physician and healthcare AI architect with over 10 years of experience spanning clinical practice, healthcare AI innovation, and interoperability systems. As the Founder and CEO of [BrainSAIT](https://www.brainsait.io), I lead the development of AI solutions that transform healthcare delivery.

## Mission

To decode the complexity of healthcare through **intelligent automation**, **interoperability**, and **human-centric AI**. My work bridges the gap between the chaotic reality of clinical practice and the precision of modern data science. I believe in the concept of **Original Intelligence (OI) + Artificial Intelligence (AI)** — combining human clinical judgment with advanced AI capabilities to enhance patient care and streamline healthcare operations.

## Expertise

**Healthcare AI & Interoperability**
- FHIR R4 and HL7 v2.x standards implementation
- Clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Healthcare data harmonization
- NPHIES (Saudi Arabia) regulatory alignment

**Software Engineering**
- Published PyPI packages: [brainsait-pyheart](https://pypi.org/project/brainsait-pyheart/) & [brainsait-pybrain](https://pypi.org/project/brainsait-pybrain/)
- Full-stack development: Python, FastAPI, React, Next.js
- Cloud architecture: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes

**Clinical Background**
- Critical Care & ICU Medicine
- Emergency Medicine
- Clinical decision support systems

## Key Projects

- **BrainSAIT Platform** — AI-powered healthcare platform serving hospitals in Saudi Arabia and Sudan
- **GIVC Platform** — Global Intelligent Virtual Care for telemedicine
- **Open Source** — Creator of `brainsait-pyheart` and `brainsait-pybrain` PyPI packages
- **Author** — Published "OI vs AI: Original Intelligence vs Artificial Intelligence"

## Global Impact

My initiatives have reached healthcare providers across continents, focus on emerging markets in the Middle East and Africa:
- 🇸🇦 **Saudi Arabia**: Full NPHIES compliance and AI-RCM integration for major hospitals.
- 🇸🇩 **Sudan**: Deployment of the GIVC Platform for telemedicine in underserved regions.
- 🇬🇧 **UK-Collaborations**: Strategic advisory for NHS trust development teams on interoperability.
- 🌍 **Open Source**: Over 50,000 downloads of clinical interoperability tools globally.
