**Dr. Mohamed El Fadil** is a visionary Physician and **Healthcare AI Architect** fusing clinical wisdom with computational intelligence. As the Founder & CEO of **[BrainSAIT](https://www.brainsait.io)**, he is pioneering the "Original Intelligence" (OI) movement—empowering doctors with AI copilots rather than replacing them.

> *"The future of medicine isn't about AI replacing doctors. It's about doctors who use AI replacing those who don't. We are building the second brain for the healthcare ecosystem."*
