## OI vs AI: Original Intelligence vs Artificial Intelligence

A groundbreaking exploration of the synergy between human intelligence and artificial intelligence in healthcare.

## Overview

**"OI vs AI: Original Intelligence vs Artificial Intelligence"** is a comprehensive book that examines the relationship between human cognitive abilities (Original Intelligence) and machine learning capabilities (Artificial Intelligence) in the context of healthcare delivery and medical practice.

## Core Thesis

The book argues that the future of healthcare does not lie in replacing physicians with AI, but rather in creating a powerful synergy where AI augments and enhances human clinical judgment - combining the irreplaceable elements of human empathy, ethical reasoning, and contextual understanding with the computational power, pattern recognition, and data processing capabilities of artificial intelligence.
